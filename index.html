                The aroma of fresh-brewed coffee engulfed the front hall of Revel Space on Fulton Market, Saturday and Sunday during CoffeeCon Chicago, as throngs of novices and aficionados gathered to learn more about this popular beverage.

              <p>
                This year, CoffeeCon hosted 40 exhibitors from local cafes to brewing manufacturers, with approximately 1,900 attendees across two days. Festival vendors provided a wide array of coffee samples, while an offering of classes focused on brewing methods, latte art and coffee sustainability.

                  Once China comes on board, the demand for specialty coffee will explode. It is critical that we teach these men and women to bring coffee quality up to par. Otherwise they’re going to be competing against the Laotians, the Vietnamese and Southern China

                “Sustainability is as much about the people involved as it is the environment of the farm,” writes Erik Barkley in a followup email, owner of Tugboat Coffee, an Addison-based roastery and one of the vendors present at this year’s Con. “Our four importers all work directly with the farms and visit them throughout the year to inspect the growing conditions, harvesting, processing and exporting of the coffee.”
              </p>


              <p>
                Since 2014, Tugboat has offered direct-trade beans sourced from countries including Guatemala, Brazil, Ethiopia and Sumatra. Direct-trade agreements allow coffee roasters to work in concert with the farmers, providing them the means to set their own pricing and regulation, helping to keep growers in business.

                  <li>Roasters work directly with coffee farmers.</li>
                  <li>Farmers dictate their own pricing and regulation.</li>
                  <li>Farmers are often payed more for their work, keeping the industry running.</li>

                      There are so many great beans you can buy from all these wonderful roasters… It’s very important for the consumer to learn how to brew. And that’s the whole philosophy of CoffeeCon.

                Sunday’s coffee sustainability panel discussed the future of the industry. Panelist Joseph Behm, president of Behmor Inc. and home roaster manufacturer, spoke of Guatemala’s efforts to teach high school students how to keep the country competitive in a growing market through understanding proper cultivation of coffee beans.

                Kevin and Patricia Sinnott, CoffeeCon co-founders and event runners, both believe the core of coffee and sustainability is about educating the consumer.

                “There are so many great beans you can buy from all these wonderful roasters… ,” Patricia Sinnot said. “It’s very important for the consumer to learn how to brew. And that’s the whole philosophy of CoffeeCon.”
